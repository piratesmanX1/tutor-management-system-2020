# tutor-management-system-2020
A group assessment that required individuals to implement their specific data structure within the system, such as the likes of Array List and Linked List. The assessment required no knowledge of database which is making the overall assessment tricky to handle as we need to rely on the memory addresses that act as a temporary storage to get the job done. In this assessment we've learned the concept of C++, Data Structures, and numerous algorithm that could exploit in other programming languages, which increased our critical thinking skill on applying the system's feature.
